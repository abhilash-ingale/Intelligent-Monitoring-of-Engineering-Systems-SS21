# Material-Classification-with-IMU-Data
Term project for Intelligent Monitoring of Engineering Systems (IMES) [summer semester, 2021]

## Objective
Given data acquired from IMU sensor mounted on a milling machine at a particular frequency (1600 Hz for our case), identify which material is being machined.

### Methodology

1. Feature Engineering Approach
 


2. Deep Learning Approach
